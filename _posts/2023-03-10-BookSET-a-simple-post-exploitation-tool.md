It's been a while since I didn't dare to create something and this time I bring you this tool that I think can add an interesting result to all those tests that we have as a red team for different companies.

Sometimes when we execute red team exercises, even after having achieved access to a certain level, we need to go a little further, such as obtaining user access credentials and that is why I have thought of this tool.

BookSET - is intended to be able to modify BookMarks mainly for Google Chrome, but tests were done on Edge and Brave Browsers.

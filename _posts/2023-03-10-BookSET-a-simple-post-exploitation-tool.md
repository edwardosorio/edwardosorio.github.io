It's been a while since I didn't dare to create something and this time I bring you this tool that I think can add an interesting result to all those tests that we have as a red team for different companies.

Sometimes when we execute red team exercises, even after having achieved access to a certain level, we need to go a little further, such as obtaining user access credentials and that is why I have thought of this tool.

BookSET - is intended to be able to modify BookMarks mainly for Google Chrome, but tests were done on Edge and Brave Browsers, remember that this script can be used to capture some credentials with Phishing sites or just redirect the "victim" to your EvilServer.

# ðŸ”´: How it works!

Lets clone the repository and install some libraries:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edwardosorio/BookSET.git

cd BookSET

pip install -r requirements.txt

```
thats it :D !!


## Help !

if you need to know the parameters from the script, pls type:

```bash
python bookSET.py -h


 ____              _     ____  _____ _____
| __ )  ___   ___ | | __/ ___|| ____|_   _|

usage: bookSET.py [-h] [-recon] [-replace]

Get and Replace all Urls from Google Chrome BookMarks

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -recon      Get all URLs Bookmarks
  -replace    Replace URLs Bookmarks


```


## [+] Recon Mode 

If you want to know what BookMarks the target has, then we just need to execute the following command line:

```bash
python bookSET.py -recon

```

and the output should be something like this:

```bash

 ____              _     ____  _____ _____
| __ )  ___   ___ | | __/ ___|| ____|_   _|
|  _ \ / _ \ / _ \| |/ /\___ \|  _|   | |
| |_) | (_) | (_) |   <  ___) | |___  | |
|____/ \___/ \___/|_|\_\|____/|_____| |_|

[+] Getting Urls from BookMarks:
 
 - https://www.facebook.com
 - https://www.bank.com
 - https://www.twitter.com
 - https://www.instagram.com
 - https://intranet.companie.org

[+] Total of BookMarks identified : [5]

```

## [+] Replace Mode

Now that we know all the BookMark that the target has, we can check all the URLs and just make a "fake website"  for each URL that we want ;) :

```bash
python bookSET.py -replace

```

and the output should be something like this:

```bash

 ____              _     ____  _____ _____
| __ )  ___   ___ | | __/ ___|| ____|_   _|
|  _ \ / _ \ / _ \| |/ /\___ \|  _|   | |
| |_) | (_) | (_) |   <  ___) | |___  | |
|____/ \___/ \___/|_|\_\|____/|_____| |_|

## [+] bookmarks.json file content

The content of "bookmarks.json" it's easy to understand, the "current_url" it's the URL that we want to change and replace it with "new_url" instead.

```bash

{
    "bookmark_bar": [
      {
        "current_url": "https://www.bank.com/",
        "new_url": "https://www.fakebank.com/"
      },
      {
        "current_url": "https://intranet.companie.org/",
        "new_url": "https://intranet.fakecompanie.org/"
      }
    ]
  }
  
  ```

NOTE: This script was tested for the following Web Browsers:

- Google Chrome
- Edge
- Brave

You just need to change the Browser Path
